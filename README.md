# Kubla Khan

A collection of commands I use for personal work. Unless otherwise stated, all commands should only be assumed to run on the most recent Stata release.

## Installing

You can install this using the [github](https://github.com/haghish/github) module in Stata. Install it using:

```
net install github, from("https://haghish.github.io/github/")
```

Then you can install this module using

```
github install josherrickson/kublakhan
```

If you'd prefer not to use the github package, or it's not working, you can install it directly with:

```
net install kublakhan, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josherrickson/kublakhan/master")
```

## Why "Kubla Khan"?

I was looking for something that was unlikely to conflict with real modules on SSC and because XanADO was too puntastic.
